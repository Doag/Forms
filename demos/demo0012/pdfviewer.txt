#PDFViewer

This example is based on the pdf-renderer project which can be found at https://pdf-renderer.dev.java.net/ I’ve taken the example included (PDFViewer.java) with the project and rewritten the PDFViewer class so it can be used as a java bean inside Oracle Forms.

###The implementation class of the Bean Item com.sun.pdfview.PDFViewer

The methods you can call

Register the bean
fbean.register_bean('BL.BEAN', 1, 'com.sun.pdfview.PDFViewer');


This is the very first operation you have to do. Set the URL/File
fbean.invoke( hBean, 1, 'doOpenUrl', 'URL');


e.g. :
fbean.invoke( hBean, 1, 'doOpenUrl', 'http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/oid/pdf/internet_directory_ds_10gr3.pdf');


The sample dialog


•Download the pdfviewer.zip file


•Unzip the pdfviewer.zip file


•Copy the pdfviewer.jar file in your /forms/java/ folder


•Update your /forms/server/formsweb.cfg configuration file:

archive=frmall.jar,pdfviewer.jar


•Notice that we update the archive tag and not the archive_jini tag because this bean needs the Sun Java plug-in 1.6 and won't run with any older version, including the Oracle JInitiator


•Open the pdfviewer.fmb module (Oracle Forms 10.1.2)


•Compile all and run the module


•The .jar files must be signed. The pdfviewer.jar file provided with the .zip file are already signed.
